# Pixel_Art_Maker

To the Evaluator/Reviewer:
The table/canvas is to be set dynamically according to the 'project rubric', that is the user can create a canvas of any (reasonable) size. But also at the same time, encouraged us to make any improvements if intended. So, I upgraded the code to make the table into a static size with flexible grids.
