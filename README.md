# Pixel_Art_Maker
To the Evaluater/reviewer:
The table/canvas is to be set dynamically according to the 'project rubric'. That is the user can create a canvas of any (reasonable) size. But also at the same time, encouraged us to make any imporvements if intended. Hence I have upgraded the code to make the table into a static size with flexible grids.
