This project is part of - `"Intro to the Programming" Nanodegree` at `Udacity` learning platform.
The goal of the project is to create custom pixel art by choosing colors from a 'color-palette'.
The live version of the project can be accessed using this [Link](https://vamshi-krishna-prime.github.io/Pixel%20Art%20Maker/).

The aim of this project is to use the front-end basics learnt throughout the Nanodegree program to build the Pixel Art Maker. 

**The Aim of the project is as follows:**

+ Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid.
+ Choose a custom color from the color-palette.
+ Upon mouse click, fill the respective cell with the chosen color.

## Instructions
1. Start with choosing the size of the canvas - `Choose Grid Size`
2. Select the desired color from a palette of colors - `Pick a Color`
3. Paint the pixels on the canvas using the brush color - `Click on the canvas`
4. Repeat step 2 for gererating custom image using multiple colors

### Model Images:
 The interface is completely user friendly and the quality of the art is depended on the user creativity. Some of the **Model images** created using Pixel Art Maker are displayed below:
